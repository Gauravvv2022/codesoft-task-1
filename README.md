A landing page using HTML and CSS is designed to engage users and guide them toward a specific action. HTML structures the content into key sections like headers, hero sections, and CTAs, while CSS styles the layout with responsive design, typography, and visual effects. Together, they create an appealing and functional first impression for visitors.
